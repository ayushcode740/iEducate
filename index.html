            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily provided by public schools (controlled
                and funded by the government at three levels: central, state and local) and private schools. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental
                right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is
                7:5.

                India has made progress in increasing the attainment rate of primary education. In 2011, Approximately
                75% of the population, aged between 7 and 10 years, was literate.[7] India's improved education system
                is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic development.[8] Much of the progress,
                especially in higher education and scientific research, has been credited to various public
                institutions. While enrollment in higher education has increased steadily over the past decade, reaching
                a Gross Enrollment Ratio of 24% in 2013,[9] there still remains a significant distance to catch up with
                tertiary education enrolment levels of developed nations,[10] a challenge that will be necessary to
                overcome in order to continue to reap a demographic dividend from India's comparatively young
                population.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Takshasila (in modern-day Pakistan) was the earliest recorded centre of
                higher learning in India from possibly 8th century BCE, and it is debatable whether it could be regarded
                a university or not in modern sense, since teachers living there may not have had official membership of
                particular colleges, and there did not seem to have existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential
                quarters in Taxila, in contrast to the later Nalanda university in eastern India. Nalanda was the oldest
                university-system of education in the world in the modern sense of university. There all subjects were
                taught in Ariano -páli Language.[23]

                Secular institutions cropped up along Buddhist monasteries. These institutions imparted practical
                education, e.g. medicine. A number of urban learning centres became increasingly visible from the period
                between 500 BCE to 400 CE. The important urban centres of learning were Nalanda (in modern-day Bihar)
                and Manassa in Nagpur, among others. These institutions systematically imparted knowledge and attracted
                a number of foreign students to study topics such as Buddhist Páli literature, logic, páli grammar, etc.
                Chanakya, a Brahmin teacher, was among the most famous teachers, associated with founding of Mauryan
                Empire.

                Sammanas and Brahmin gurus historically offered education by means of donations, rather than charging
                fees or the procurement of funds from students or their guardians. Later, stupas, temples also became
                centres of education; religious education was compulsory, but secular subjects were also taught.
                Students were required to be brahmacaris or celibates. The knowledge in these orders was often related
                to the tasks a section of the society had to perform. The priest class, the Sammanas, were imparted
                knowledge of religion, philosophy, and other ancillary branches while the warrior class, the Kshatriya,
                were trained in the various aspects of warfare. The business class, the Vaishya, were taught their trade
                and the working class of the Shudras was generally deprived of educational advantages.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">At the school level, National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS)
                provides opportunities for continuing education to those who missed completing school education. 14 lakh
                students are enrolled at the secondary and higher secondary level through open and distance
                learning.[100] In 2012 various state governments also introduced "State Open School" to provide distance
                education.[101]

                At higher education level, Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) co-ordinates distance
                learning. It has a cumulative enrolment of about 15 lakh, serviced through 53 regional centres and 1,400
                study centres with 25,000 counselors. The Distance Education Council (DEC), an authority of IGNOU is
                co-co-ordinating 13 State Open Universities and 119 institutions of correspondence courses in
                conventional universities. While distance education institutions have expanded at a very rapid rate, but
                most of these institutions need an up gradation in their standards and performance. There is a large
                proliferation of courses covered by distance mode without adequate infrastructure, both human and
                physical. There is a strong need to correct these imbalances.[102]

                Massive open online course are made available for free by the HRD ministry and various educational
                institutes.</p>
